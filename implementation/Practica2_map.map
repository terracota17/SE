Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,033 out of  15,360   13%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,355 out of  15,360   21%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,569 out of   7,680   33%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,569 out of   2,569 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,569   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,476 out of  15,360   22%
    Number used as logic:             2,551
    Number used as a route-thru:        121
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     704
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     100

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 38 out of     173   21%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      23
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      24   70%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of       8   37%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.88

Peak Memory Usage:  259 MB
